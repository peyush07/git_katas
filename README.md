Tasks not visible in commit history :

Kata 8 (rebase-branch) : branch greeting was rebased with master branch. Before rebase branch greeting had 7 commits and branch master has 13 commits at that time out of which 7 were overlapping with greeting. After rebase greeting had 13 commits as well and there were no conflicts in merging.

Kata 9 : commited below kata 10 with commit starting with revert

Kata 11 : cleaning was performed to remove untracked files created by vimdiff in the local repository using the following commands:
  git clean -d -x -n (for dry run)
  git clean -d -x -f (for removing the files)
  
Kata 13: command 'git rebase -i <commit-hash>' was ran to reorder the history but no changes were observed in the order of commits.
